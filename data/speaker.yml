    summary: "Let's talk about salaries, diversity, career development, getting compensated in gold and silver, paying taxes in livestock and Ruby code.
    We at Travis CI have been working on a new salary system to determine how much we pay whom, when employees get raises and a whole range of other things. After lots of back and forth, we ended up with a Sinatra application to solve salary questions.
    Expect to explore the topic from many different angles and levels. We'll look at decisions, realisations and implications, as well as interesting parts of the implementation."

    summary: "隨著物聯網與雲端服務的盛行，傳統的 server class microprocessor 逐漸地從 general propose 轉變成為 workload specific；雲端服務採購 workload specific processor 的比重從 2010 年 9% 提升到今年至少 30%，比重逐年增加。為了因應 workload specific processor，許多程式語言都逐漸從 interpreter base、JIT base 轉向到 compiler base。Ruby language 的架構是採用純 interpreter base，致使 Skymizer 在針對客戶 workload 優化時，遭遇許多困難。
    本篇 talk 會指出 Ruby langauge 現行 VM 上設計的問題，說明為何其無法針對客戶 workload 進行客製化，以期之後社群的努力與改進。"

    subject: 'Buidling HUGE web apps: Rails at 1,000,000 Lines of Code'
    summary: |-
      <p>There&#39;s big, and there&#39;s HUGE. Conventional wisdom says that huge teams with huge apps are slow and unresponsive. However, with great people, the right culture and diligent engineering, a team of 60 can perform like a team of 6.
      Join us for a story of HUGE. Learn which tools, patterns and practices help you manage growth, and which don&#39;t. Hear how trust in your teammates trumps consistency of design, and how scale changes priorities.
      Building a huge app takes focus and leadership, but if you prioritize people over process, you can stay fast, agile and bug free even when you&#39;re huge.</p>

    subject: To Code Is Human
    summary: |-
      <p>Mastering the art of programming requires both the ability to rapidly understand specific problem domains, as well as comprehensive working knowledge of software development tools, from individual libraries, to programming languages, to the fundamental limits of computing hardware itself.</p>
      <p>But what is often neglected is an understanding of the most heavily-used and relied-upon tool in the software developer&#39;s toolbox: the programmer&#39;s brain itself.</p>
      <p>In this talk, we will combine the art of programming with the science of cognitive psychology, and emerge with a set of simple, proven techniques that we can use to craft software that is drastically less buggy, easier to understand, and more adaptive in the face of change.</p>

      <p>Rails patterns are amazing for prototyping, but they are actually very bad practices for large scale production applications.
      Also, Rails comes with lot of handy tools to break many barriers for web beginners while introducing tons of good practices. Again, those good practices are a good introduction, but they don&#39;t fit large scale production applications, especially when it comes to modern practices in front end world.</p>
      <p>I will discuss why those patterns are not a fit, and how they can be replaced (completely dropped for another technology, or how to improve them). Delivering good practices that should be implemented as soon as your project is no more a prototype to scale your tests speed, your maintainability.</p>

    subject: Using database to pull your applications weight
    summary: |-
      <p>Most Ruby on Rails application out there in the world deals with the manipulation and presentation of data. So the speed of our application has a relationship with how fast we work with data. Ruby on Rails, the swiss army knife of web development, is good with presenting data. But when it comes to crunching huge volumes of data, our rails application starts to slow down. Here we are not talking about joining a couple of rows from multiple tables, but about processing months of historical data and providing meaning full information.</p>
      <p>Databases are good at processing data, but we sometimes make the mistake of just using it to as a file cabinet. The database is optimized to crunch GB&#39;s of data and return to us the results that we need.</p>
      <p>So my talk would be about how to optimize your database so as to speed up your existing Ruby on Rails application.</p>

      large-scale scientific computation with CRuby is too time-consuming as the number
      of loops gets bigger. This experience led me to create VirtualModule, which lets
      you reduce execution time by running your arbitrary Ruby code on the other language
      VM process. In this talk, you will find out about when CRuby doesn&#39;t perform
      very well and what kind of bottlenecks you can workaround using VirtualModule.</p>"

      希望透過這個 talk 讓聽眾暸解，要串接 C 和 JAVA 等語言撰寫的分析工具時，可以利用 RUBY 的套件，撰寫簡單的 code 來處理複雜的分析流程．我們將工具與參數的使用，撰寫成 RUBY 模組，並利用 templete 系統組合出一個 robust 的資料分析流程(Cagnut)。
      執行分析流程通常會花費相當大的資源與時間，我們將以 Cagnut 為核心，探討如何撰寫輔助套件(cagnut-cluster)，讓 Cagnut 可以運用不同 cluster 上的排程系統，如 LSF、SGE、Torque (PBS)，達到節省分析巨量資料的時間。</p>

      <p>Phoenix 是根基於 Elixir 語言的 Web MVC 框架。除了 Elixir 與 Ruby 語法上的相似之外，這框架也從 Rails 「致敬」了許多概念及元件。這個講題會比較 Rails 與 Phoenix 在概念上相似及相異的部份，並告訴你用 Phoenix 開發時，哪些觀念及手法可以繼續使用，而哪些部份需要新的觀念，以及為什麼要這樣設計。</p>
      <p>而對於正在使用 Rails 的開發者而言，也可以找一些 Rails 上的設計問題，及能適用於 Rails 的新手法及觀念。</p>

    subject: Value And Pain to Keep Rails Applications Alive
    summary: |-
      <p>In 2014-2015 my team migrated a series of applications from Rails 2.3.5 to 4.2.1, and Ruby 1.8 to 2.1. Our goal was to add large features, while substantially refactoring the whole system. It was a big challenge!</p>
      <p>This talk will cover the timeline of the project and talk about all the things a team performing a large migration of Ruby and Rails will need to do. Secondly, I&#39;ll talk about importance, hardness, and some techniques to keep Rails applications healthy and maintainable. </p>

    subject: Isomorphic web programming in Ruby
    summary: |-
      <p>For JavaScript, The method is available that is the isomorphic programming.
      The isomorphic programming is the method exploiting the advantages obtained by same code running on both the server-side and client-side.
      For examle, React is reducing the overhead of iniitial rendering in client side by server side rendering.
      On the other hand, for the rubyists, We can also write ruby code on client side by using Opal.</p>
      <p>This talk introduces a new framework for isomorphic programming with the Opal: Menilite.
      Menilite shares model code between the server side and the client side by marshalling objects and storing them in the database automatically.
      As a result, code duplication is reduced and APIs are no longer a necessity.
      Isomorphic programming can significantly accelerate your progress on a project; I sincerely hope you find it helpful in developing web applications.
      Menilite aims to expand the playing field for the Ruby language, a language optimized for developer happiness. I&#39;m sure you will agree that we will find even more happiness by bringing Ruby to the front-end as well.</p>
